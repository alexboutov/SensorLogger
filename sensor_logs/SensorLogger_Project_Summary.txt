CHANGES SINCE LAST SUMMARY
Orientation, pipelines, and diagnostics

E1 (done): Instrument orientation staleness (GM).

LA CSV now logs oriAgeGM and yawGMdeg per row.

oriTsNs = max(latestGRAV.ts, latestMAG.ts), oriAgeGM = max(0, laTsNs - oriTsNs)*1e-9.

E2 (added, diagnostic only): Added Rotation Vector (RV) pipeline.

Logs P_rv, V_rv, oriAgeRV, yawRVdeg.

E3 (added, diagnostic only): Added ACC – g pipeline.

Device frame: linDev = ACC - GRAVITY, then rotate with R? (GM) to world ENU.

Logs P_accGM, V_accGM, accAgeSec.

Correct heading & world transform

Fixed sign/axes for GM/RV: Use R? to map device?world (ENU), then project:
dirFx = sin(radians(azimuthDeg)) (East), dirFy = cos(radians(azimuthDeg)) (North).

ACC pipeline corrected: compute ACC - gravity in device, then rotate with R? to world before projection.

Smoothing (diagnostic only; no behavior change)

Centered SMA on P for all three pipes (n=20 ? window=41).

Integrated smoothed velocity & distance per pipe:
Pgm_smooth, Prv_smooth, PaccGM_smooth, Vgm_smooth, Sgm_smooth, Vrv_smooth, Srv_smooth, VaccGM_smooth, SaccGM_smooth.

Data quality flags (diagnostic only)

Staleness: isOriStaleGM, isOriStaleRV, isAccStale (thresholds 40 ms).

LA health: isLaSat (|LA|>25 m/s²), isLaJump (per-sample jump >5 m/s²).

Projection outliers: isPgmOutlier, isPrvOutlier (|P|>10 m/s²).

Environment: isGravAnom (|g|-9.81 >1.5), isMagAnom (|B| outside 20–70 µT).

Post-processing after STOP (file rewrite in-place)

Linear detrend of velocities per pipe: estimate slope/intercept for V, V_rv, V_accGM and smoothed counterparts.

Add detrended velocity columns:
V_detrend, V_rv_detrend, V_accGM_detrend, Vgm_smooth_detrend, Vrv_smooth_detrend, VaccGM_smooth_detrend.

Append footer rows with #slope and #intercept (high precision).

In-place rewrite of the original LA CSV (no duplicate run_<NEWtime>_*.csv): the app memorizes the LA filename and replaces it via a temp file + rename.

Formatting: most numeric columns now 3 decimals; footer slopes/intercepts remain 9 decimals.

UI improvements

Hides numeric keypad immediately on Done, on focus loss, and on START/STOP.

Removed duplicate <EditText> from layout; single Material TextInputEditText remains.

Azimuth normalized into [0, 360) before passing to service.

Behavior unchanged (primary path)

The reference P/V used for combined CSV and compatibility remains GM (raw) integrated on the LA clock.

All new columns are diagnostic/additive—no gating, no filtering of the primary path.

SERVICE STABILITY & ORDERING

STOP: isLogging=false ? unregister sensors ? cancel writes ? close writers.

All writes guarded by isLogging/writersOpen.

Single-threaded dispatcher ensures FIFO write order.

TIMING

LA timing uses event.timestamp (monotonic ns).

laClockSec = accumulated seconds since START.

ACC/GRAV/MAG/RV use their own sensor timestamps.

P in combined is GM P when available; else 0.

OPEN ISSUES

Validate if orientation staleness is the primary driver of post-motion V offsets across environments.

Compare GM vs RV vs ACC–g pipelines using uncalibrated end-distance error (20 m tests).

Determine robust oriAge thresholds and whether gating helps (E4/E5).

Assess ACC–g consistency indoors and under dynamics.

Consider lightweight online bias prediction (per-run slope/intercept) from early-run features.

DONE TODAY

Fixed heading mapping and R? world transform; corrected ACC–g pipeline.

Added RV and ACC–g diagnostic pipelines; centered SMA smoothing + smoothed V/S.

Implemented quality flags and post-processing detrend with in-place CSV rewrite.

Standardized 3-decimal formatting (runtime & detrended columns); high-precision footers.

UI polish: hide keypad on Done/focus loss/START–STOP; removed duplicate input.

ENVIRONMENT SETUP

JAVA_HOME ? JDK 17 (Windows). PATH includes %JAVA_HOME%\bin.

Android Studio JBR present; Gradle uses JDK 17 via org.gradle.java.home.

If device not detected over USB: try another port (SM-G930V fix observed).

BUILD & RUN PROGRESS

Foreground service with wakelock; starts/stops cleanly.

CSVs generated with monotonic sensor timestamps.

LA CSV now includes diagnostics, smoothing, flags, and post-processed detrends.

File rewrite is in-place (no duplicate timestamped LA CSVs).

PHYSICAL DEVICE TESTING

Samsung SM-G930V (Android 8.0, API 26).

Desk tests: P sign/direction reasonable; sign fixed for GM/RV; ACC–g corrected.

20 m walks (forward/back with static UI azimuth) used to validate heading/sign and drift.

KEY DECISIONS & PREFERENCES

No ZUPT (by design). Expose and fix root causes.

One-change workflow for behavior changes; diagnostics can be layered if they don’t alter reference behavior.

Keep project minimal (only essentials).

Before any drop-in update, paste current file to ensure consistency.

CURRENT BASELINE

Orientation:

GM: R_gm = getRotationMatrix(gravity, magnetic)

RV: R_rv = getRotationMatrixFromVector(rotVec)

World = ENU; device?world via R?.

Heading from UI: dirFx = sin(rad(azimuthDeg)), dirFy = cos(rad(azimuthDeg)).

Projection: P = ax_world*dirFx + ay_world*dirFy.

Integration: V[i] = V[i-1] + P[i]*dt with dt from LA timestamps.

Reference path for compatibility: GM raw P/V.

Files: per-sensor CSVs + combined snapshot CSV; LA CSV augmented as above.

HYPOTHESES TO TEST

H1 Orientation staleness (GRAV+MAG) during motion skews P.

H2 Use orientation cadence for dt; integrate only when orientation is fresh.

H3 Low-pass filter LA to reduce sharp swings (tune cutoff).

H4 Newer hardware with faster GRAV+MAG reduces lag.

H5 Gyro-aided orientation (RV) improves projection under dynamics.

H6 Use ACC minus gravity instead of vendor LA.

H7 Cross-sensor timestamp skew and fusion caveats (GRAV low-passed, MAG noisy).

SINGLE-CHANGE EXPERIMENT QUEUE

E1 Log GM orientation age & yaw — ? (diagnostic only)

E2 Add RV pipeline & logs — ? (diagnostic only)

E3 ACC–g vs LA for projection/integration — ? (diagnostic only)

E4 Gate integration by orientation-freshness (behavior change) — ?

E5 Integrate on orientation cadence using latest LA (behavior change) — ?

E6 Low-pass filter LA (behavior change; currently diagnostic-only SMA) — ?

E7 Repeat tests on newer hardware (env change) — ?

TEST PROTOCOL

Place phone with known heading; set azimuth in UI.

Phases: Still =5 s ? Move 1–3 s (straight) ? Still =5 s.

Save CSVs; note scenario (desk/location/device).

Plot oriAgeGM, P, V; compute stillness metrics (mean/std of V).

Compare end-distance error vs 20 m per pipe (uncalibrated).

Decide whether to proceed with gating/cadence/filters.

NEXT ACTION

Run paired 20 m tests across locations; share LA CSVs and quick plots of oriAgeGM, P, V, smoothed V/S.

Compare GM vs RV vs ACC–g end-distance errors (no area matching).

If staleness correlates, trial E4/E5; otherwise, tune smoothing window or explore early-run bias prediction (ridge) for online correction.

PARKING LOT / OPEN QUESTIONS

Acceptable oriAge threshold (start with 20–40 ms)?

Does RV hold up indoors at your locations?

What LPF cutoff preserves dynamics without hiding true acceleration?

Mounting repeatability across desks/locations?

Data volume needed to train a simple predictor for per-run slope/intercept?

DECISIONS LOG

ZUPT: excluded by design.

Workflow: one behavioral change at a time; measure ? decide ? proceed.

Diagnostics may be layered if they don’t alter reference behavior.
